We've achieved all of our goals in the development of Program 1.

We had some difficulties in the development of Program 2, related
with the lack of time to fully test its "bugs". One problem we
found was that we could not make our program accept letters separated
by spaces on the fourth part of the program.

We also consider that our programs could be better in terms of 
organization and formatting: we should have commented more and
better and our program should be more modulated (more functions,
shorter functions).
